legonet implementation explanation:
	for example, if in channel=4, out channel=16 and n_split=2 and n_lego=0.5
	this legonet is like doing CNN twice with (in,out) =(4,8)->(8,16)
	aux_coefficients and aux_combination is making the filters(weights)
	self.lego is used as weight at first CNN
	and second CNN is made with lego filters 
np.unique---and parameters as well
np.unique-->returns elements with redundant values erased
	if use with return_counts as True, it returns array with how many counts of one element in original array. 

Things to know:
	to dynamically choose, first study
	lego_feature return size of array
	how to choose dynamically from input
