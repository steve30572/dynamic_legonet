legonet implementation explanation:
	for example, if in channel=4, out channel=16 and n_split=2 and n_lego=0.5
	this legonet is like doing CNN twice with (in,out) =(4,8)->(8,16)
	aux_coefficients and aux_combination is making the filters(weights)
	self.lego is used as weight at first CNN
	and second CNN is made with lego filters 
	nn.init.kaiming_normal_ function is a tool to avoid vanishing gradient problem or exploding gradient problem



next, what scatter_ function does and more exact understanding of
